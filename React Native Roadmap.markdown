5. **State Management**
   - Explore React Context API and basic state management libraries like Redux or Zustand.
   - Resources: Redux Toolkit Docs, Kent C. Dodds’ React tutorials.
   - Goal: Manage app-wide state in a small project.

6. **Routing in React**
   - Learn React Router for navigation in single-page applications.
   - Resources: React Router Docs.
   - Goal: Implement multi-page navigation in a React app.

---

## Phase 3: Getting Started with React Native
Now, transition to React Native to build mobile apps.

7. **Set Up React Native Environment**
   - Install Node.js, npm, and React Native CLI or Expo CLI.
   - Set up Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS) emulators.
   - Resources: React Native Docs, Expo Docs.
   - Goal: Run a "Hello World" app on an emulator or physical device.

8. **Learn React Native Core Concepts**
   - Understand React Native components (View, Text, Image, ScrollView, FlatList).
   - Learn styling with StyleSheet and handling touch events.
   - Resources: React Native Docs, The Net Ninja YouTube tutorials.
   - Goal: Build a simple app with basic UI components (e.g., a list-based app).

9. **Navigation in React Native**
   - Learn React Navigation for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
   - Resources: React Navigation Docs.
   - Goal: Implement multi-screen navigation in an app.

---

## Phase 4: Intermediate React Native Development
Deepen your knowledge with more complex features and tools.

10. **State Management in React Native**
    - Apply Context API or Redux Toolkit for managing state in mobile apps.
    - Learn asynchronous storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) for persisting data.
    - Resources: Redux Toolkit Docs, React Native AsyncStorage Docs.
    - Goal: Build an app with persistent state (e.g., a note-taking app).

11. **API Integration**
    - Learn to fetch data from REST APIs using fetch or Axios.
    - Handle loading states, errors, and caching.
    - Resources: JSONPlaceholder (for practice APIs), Axios Docs.
    - Goal: Build an app that fetches and displays data from an API (e.g., a weather app).

12. **Animations in React Native**
    - Explore Animated API and libraries like React Native Reanimated or Lottie.
    - Resources: React Native Animations Docs, Lottie Docs.
    - Goal: Add basic animations (e.g., fade, slide) to an app.

---

## Phase 5: Advanced React Native Development
Focus on performance, testing, and production-ready apps.

13. **Performance Optimization**
    - Learn to optimize FlatList, reduce re-renders, and use memoization (useMemo, useCallback).
    - Understand image optimization and lazy loading.
    - Resources: React Native Performance Docs.
    - Goal: Optimize an existing app for better performance.

14. **Testing React Native Apps**
    - Learn unit testing with Jest and component testing with React Native Testing Library.
    - Explore end-to-end testing with Detox.
    - Resources: Jest Docs, Detox Docs.
    - Goal: Write tests for components and user flows in an app.

15. **Building and Deploying Apps**
    - Learn to build APKs (Android) and IPAs (iOS) for distribution.
    - Understand app store submission processes (Google Play, Apple App Store).
    - Resources: React Native Docs (Publishing), Expo Publishing Guide.
    - Goal: Deploy a simple app to an app store or distribute it via TestFlight.

---

## Phase 6: Specialization and Real-World Projects
Apply your skills to real-world scenarios and specialize.

16. **Build Portfolio Projects**
    - Create 2-3 complex apps (e.g., e-commerce app, chat app, fitness tracker).
    - Integrate features like push notifications, geolocation, or camera access.
    - Resources: Firebase (for backend), React Native APIs.
    - Goal: Showcase projects on GitHub and a personal portfolio.

17. **Explore Advanced Libraries and Tools**
